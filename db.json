With the introduction of hooks, functional components have become the standard way of writing React components.\n\nKey best practices include:\n1. Using hooks for state management\n2. Keeping components small and focused\n3. Avoiding prop drilling with Context API\n4. Using custom hooks for reusable logic\n5. Proper error boundaries and error handling\n\nBy following these practices, you'll write React code that's easier to test, maintain, and scale."

      "content": "TypeScript has become the go-to choice for large-scale JavaScript applications. Its strong type system helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.\n\nWhen using TypeScript in production, consider:\n- Setting strict mode in tsconfig.json\n- Creating reusable type definitions\n- Using interfaces for contracts\n- Leveraging generics for flexible code\n- Maintaining consistent naming conventions\n\nInvesting time in TypeScript upfront will save you countless debugging hours later."
